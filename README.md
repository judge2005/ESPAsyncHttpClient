# ESPAsyncHttpClient
A very basic asynchronous HTTP client for the ESP8266 that uses ESPAsyncTCP. it was written for a very specific need, so it is not a truly general class.

This code is provided as-is. I am more than happy for anyone to take it and use it, or turn it into an actual general library.
